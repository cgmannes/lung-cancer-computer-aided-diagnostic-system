# Lung Cancer Computer-Aided Diagnostic System

This respository contains python files for a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for lung nodule classification in 
magnetic resonance images. The CAD system employs two different approaches for nodule classification. 
The first method employs Local Binary Patterns (LBP) enhanced with Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to construct
a feature vector. Classification is achieved using K-Nearesr Neighbors technqique. The second approach uses a VGG 16
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with pretrained weights for nodule classification. An overview of the work and the 
results of the project can be seen in the poster, CAD_poster.pdf.
